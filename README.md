# Netflix Userbase Analysis
Netflix is a streaming service, specializing in offering a diverse selection of movies and TV shows across various genres. With a vast amount of data on viewer preferences and engagement that has been previously underutilized, this project analyzes the data to uncover critical insights that will further enhance Netflix's commercial success.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Customer Demographics: Analysis of customer age groups, gender distribution, and regional preferences to identify key audience segments.
- Subscription Analysis: Evaluation of subscription distribution (Basic, Standard, Premium).

This analysis purely uses Microsoft Excel because the data set is manageable in size. My primary goal is to produce easily understandable and also shareable results.

- The majority of Netflix subscribers are adults, within the 36-55 age group, accounting for 63% of total users. The remaining 37% are young adults aged 20-35. Notably, there are no active users under the age of 20 (teenagers) or above 55 (seniors), indicating a concentration of subscribers within the working-age population.
- The United States, Spain, and Canada are the top three contributing countries. The United States leads with 18% of total revenue, followed closely by Spain at 17.7% and Canada at 13%. The remaining revenue is evenly distributed across seven other countries, each contributing 7%. This trend highlights the platform’s strong market presence in North America and parts of Europe.

**Recommendations**
- Expand Market Reach to Teenagers and Seniors: Netflix could introduce tailored content and marketing campaigns targeting these age groups. For teenagers, this could involve partnerships with influencers, exclusive youth-oriented content, and student discounts. For seniors, Netflix could focus on classic films, documentaries, and simplified user interfaces to enhance accessibility.
- Enhance Engagement in High-Revenue Regions: With the United States, Spain, and Canada contributing the most to total revenue (18%, 17.7%, and 13%, respectively), it is essential to reinforce Netflix’s presence in these markets. This could involve localized content production, targeted promotional offers, and enhanced customer engagement strategies to maintain and grow subscriber loyalty.
